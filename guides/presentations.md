# Presentations Guide

The monthly meet-up provides you an opportunity to share you passion, knowledge and experiences with
other members of the group. There are four suggested formats you can choose from:

### 1. Full-Presentation

* ~30-40 mins in length (aim for a ~30 minute talk, allowing ~10 minutes for questions)  
* Great for prepared presenters

### 2. Demi-presentation

* ~15-20 mins (aim for a ~15 minute talk, allowing ~5 minutes for questions)
* Great for presenters that want to share, but don't have the time to prepare a longer presentation

### 3. Code and Tell

* ~15-20 mins (aim for a ~15 minute talk, allowing ~5 minutes for questions)
* Present a casual walk-through of code from an application or library you have written
* Great for coders who do not wish to prepare a formal presentation

### 4. Lightning talk

* 5 mins maximum (questions depending on time available)
* Great opportunity for first time presenters

After the presentation, members will be given the opportunity to ask you questions. You may also
answer questions one-on-one after your presentation, as an alternative to answering questions in
front of the group if you prefer.

## Preparing your presentations

There are many good resources available on preparing for your presentation. Gary Bernhardt's [How to
prepare a talk](https://www.deconstructconf.com/blog/how-to-prepare-a-talk) is an example. If you
think there are additional resources that would be helpful to include in this Guide, please create
an issue with your suggestion.

## Booking your presentation

Please message one of the organizers on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/montrealelixir/) to
notify them that you would like to present and for which month. Within two weeks of the meet-up, we
would need to know:

* Presentation format (full, demi, lightning)
* Title and description
* Your biography (1-2 sentences)
* Twitter handle
* Can the talk be recorded
* Open to questions in the group
* Adapter requirements for HDMI connection (if required)

## On the Night

Before you present, please ensure you have completed the tasks in the [Presenters
Checklist](../checklists/presenters.md). These tasks will ensure your presentation goes smoothly -
and who doesn't want that!
