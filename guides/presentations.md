# Presentations Guide

The monthly meet-up provides you an opportunity to share you passion, knowledge and experiences with other members of the group. There are three suggested formats you can choose from:

### 1. Full-Presentation

* ~30-40 mins in length (aim for a ~30 minute talk, allowing ~10 minutes for questions)  
* Great for prepared presenters

### 2. Demi-presentation

* ~15-20 mins (aim for a ~15 minute talk, allowing ~5 minutes for questions)
* Great for presenters that want to share, but don't have the time to prepare a longer presentation

### 3. Lightning talk

* 5 mins maximum (questions depending on time available)
* Great opportunity for first time presenters

After the presentation, members will be given the opportunity to ask you questions. You may also answer questions one-on-one after your presentation, as an alternative to answering questions in front of the group if you prefer.

## Booking your presentation

Please message one of the organizers on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/montrealelixir/) to notify them that you would like to present and for which month. Within two weeks of the meet-up, we would need to know:

* Presentation format (full, demi, lightning)
* Title and description
* Your biography (1-2 sentences)
* Twitter handle
* Can the talk be recorded
* Open to questions in the group
* Adapter requirements for HDMI connection (if required)
